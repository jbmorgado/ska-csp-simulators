# ska-csp-simulators

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ska-csp-simulators/badge/?version=latest)](https://developer.skatelescope.org/projects/ska-csp-simulators/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This project creates a set Tango devices coded in PyTango simulating the behavior of some of the CSP subordinate sub-systems.
These devices can be used to study the CSP.LMC devices behavior when abnormal conditions are generated by one or more of the
sub-systems' devices.
